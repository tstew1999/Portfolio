    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h4>I don't know how you found this website considering I haven't sent to anyone yet.</h4>
    <h4>Regardless, my name is Thomas Stewart and I'm an aspiring programmer.</h4>
    <h4>I apologize for the lack of style and content on this website; given my current skills, fleshing out the site wouldn't be much better than straight HTML.</h4>
    <h4>As of now, I'm focused on learning Python and Java first instead of the typical web development path.</h4>
    <h4>Python because automation and web scraping are very interesting; Java because I want to build the Minecraft server and mods I always dreamed of.</h4>
    <h4>If you wish to follow my progress feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/tstew1999">github</a>.</h4>
